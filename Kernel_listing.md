## About
This project is aimed at enabling custom kernels to be built and provided for use by the 
Illinois Computes Research Notebook community broadly. This enables individuals that are less familiar with environment 
management and package installation to nevertheless access custom software in an easy and maintainable way.

## This Readme
Please refer to the [Contributing](./Contributing_kernels) document in this repository on standards for contribution to 
pre-compiled kernels within the ICRN system. This document exists to catalogue the kernels which are part of this project
and to provide versioning, contact, and expiration information for each kernel.

If you have questions or concerns regarding a custom kernel's functionality, please find the kernel in the list below
and reach out to the listed contact.
