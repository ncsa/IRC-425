## About
This project is aimed at enabling custom kernels to be built and provided for use by the 
Illinois Computes Research Notebook community broadly. This enables individuals that are less familiar with environment 
management and package installation to nevertheless access custom software in an easy and maintainable way.

## How to contribute
Please refer to the ['Contributing'](./Contributing.md) document in this repository on standards for contribution to 
pre-compiled kernels within the ICRN
